This is a two-page sample. The site can be viewed [here](login.html).

The first page is the login page which allows users to login with username and password. Currently the page does not have any validation of user.
There is also a checkbox for "remember me", which allows the website to use cookie. The "forget password?" link is for users to reset their password. Both of the functionality is not realized in this sample, just an expression of thoughts.

After the user login, the index.html page works as a simple "File Explorer" with some sample table data. Users are allowed to create new files, edit the details (name, date and note) of the files and delete the files. As for this sample page, the sample files are only simple data with no real file stored in the back end.
